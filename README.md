## Overview

This is my first serious Python project.
The purpose of this project is to apply Python concepts by building a
real, evolving program rather than isolated scripts.

The application helps me stay consistent by logging daily entries
related to my work and energy levels. Over time, this data becomes a
dataset I can reflect on to understand my habits, productivity patterns,
and need for rest.

Showing up every day is a core motivation behind this project.

## Project Timeline

**21-01-2026**  
I started this project to track the tasks I perform and my daily energy
levels. The goal was to create a personal dataset for reflection while
building the habit of consistent daily logging.

**30-01-2026**  
I expanded the project by adding new features incrementally.
This project serves both as a learning exercise in Python and as a
working, tangible application that I can include on my resume.

## What This Project Tracks

This application collects data about my habits and work patterns, such as:

- Date
- Tasks completed
- Energy levels
- Menstrual cycle phase
- Notes and motivations influencing the day

## Purpose

Through this project, I aim to:
- Practice Python through a real-world use case
- Build consistency and self-awareness
- Learn how to design, extend, and maintain a working application over time
