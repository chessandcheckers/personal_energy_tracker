The purpose of this project is to track myself - the tasks i do
& my energy levels. This is meant to be a dataset for me to 
reflect on. 
not only is it accumulating data, it is also making me show up 
every day which is the main motivation of this project.

this project is my first project. im building it using python. i first developed the basic-most functionalities
then went on to add necessary features. this application is to learn skills as well as to have a tangible and
working project to put on my resume.
this project is to collect data about my habits and patterns:
 - how do i work
